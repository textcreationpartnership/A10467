            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Am not ignorant (friendly Reader) that hitherto, in writing, neuer any man pleaſed all; nor will I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be the firſt. To perſwade the courteous, were cauſeleſſe, for they are naturally kind; and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the captious, were bootleſſe, for they will not be diuerted: Let the firſt make true vſe of theſe my Labours, and they ſhall find much pleaſure and profit therein; let the laſt (if they like not) leaue it, and it ſhall not offend them. To make apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or exornation, in defence or commendation of the ſubiect whereof I treat, were needleſſe; it being alreadie, in the worlds opinion, of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent habilitie and reputation, both to defend and commend it ſelfe: Onely of my manner and order in handling the ſame, I will ſay ſomewhat, as briefely as I may, for thy better inſtruction and vnderſtanding thereof.</p>
            <p>In generall, I haue dispoſed and digeſted the ſame into foure Bookes; whereof, the two former tend ſpecially to the principles and rules of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, with performance thereby of many vſefull and neceſſarie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the two later, to matter of ſuruey, with many inſtrumentall concluſions, tending as well to that, as diuers other purpoſes.</p>
            <p>More particularly, in my firſt Booke, I begin with the Matters, Grounds, and Elements of <hi>GEOMETRIE,</hi> as the definitions and termes of art belonging thereunto; moſt fitting firſt by the Practicioner to be learned and well vnderſtood: then next haue I placed therein diuers Geometricall <hi>THEOREMES,</hi> as the foundations, grounds, and reaſons whereon the practike part dependeth.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond (hauing formerly laid the foundation) I ſhew the means and practike operation of manie neceſſarie concluſions and Geometricall <hi>PROBLEMES,</hi> as the diſtinction, application, and diuiſion of Lines and Angles; and the deſcription, reduction, addition, inſcription, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, diuiſion, and ſeparation of all formes and kinds of ſuperficiall Figures, with their ſeuerall dimenſions. And conſidering, that as well in the <hi>THEOREMES</hi> of the firſt Booke, as the <hi>PROBLEMES</hi> in the ſecond, I wholly omit (for breuities ſake, and auoiding confuſion to
<pb facs="tcp:16637:5"/>the learner) their ſeuerall demonſtrations, vſing onely explication and conſtruction; I therefore expreſſe in the Margent againſt thoſe <hi>THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REMES</hi> and <hi>PROBLEMES,</hi> where, how, and in what place of <hi>EVCLID, RAMVS,</hi> and other Authors, to find their ſeuerall demonſtrations at large: and likewiſe, at the end of each conſtruction, I haue inſerted the like numbers and notes of reference, from the <hi>THEOREMES</hi> in the firſt Booke, to the <hi>PROBLEMES</hi> in the ſecond; and the contrarie: whereby moſt plainely and readily is found, and had, as well the reaſon and ground of any <hi>PROBLEME</hi> propoſed, as the effect and operation of any <hi>THEOREME</hi> deliuered.</p>
            <p>In the third Booke I begin with the deſcription of the ſeuerall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments fit and vſuall for Suruey; and of their ſeuerall vſes: wherein ſomewhat haue I ſpoken (though too ſparingly) concerning their abuſe; being now growne ſhamefully generall, by the multitude of ſimple and ignorant perſons (vſing, or rather abuſing, that good plaine Inſtrument, called the <hi>Plaine Table</hi>) who hauing but once obſerued a Surueyor, by looking ouer his ſhoulder, how and in what manner be directs his ſights, and drawes his lines thereon; they preſently apprehend the buſineſſe, prouide them of ſome caſt <hi>Plaine Table,</hi> and within ſmall time after, you ſhall heare them tell you wonders, and what rare feats they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; yea, and will vndertake (or I will for them) that for tenne groats a day, and their charges defrayed, they ſhall be able to vndoe any man they deale with; or at leaſtwiſe, to doe him ſuch wrong and preiudice, as perhaps he might, with more eaſe, and leſse loſse, haue giuen ten pounds a day to one that would haue ſpoken leſſe, and performed more. But what ſhould I ſay more of them then thus, <hi>Monoculi inter caecos oculiſſimi ſunt,</hi> and ſo will I leaue the blind, with tumbling the blind into the myre.</p>
            <p>I further deſcribe in this third Booke, the compoſition and vſe of an Inſtrument of mine owne, which I call the <hi>Peractor,</hi> and of a Chayne, which I call the <hi>Decimall</hi> Chayne, with the diuiſions and parts thereof: which rightly vnderſtood and practiſed (I dare boldly ſay without oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) is farre more vſefull and abſolute for ſpeed and exactneſſe, then any yet euer vſed: And I will maintaine by ſufficient demonſtration, that no man (vſing not the ſame, or the like) ſhall attaine to the ſame or the like perfection, for preciſe exactneſſe in any dimenſion, as I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by performe.</p>
            <p>And I further ſhew therein, the beſt, ſpeedieſt, and exacteſt meanes, for the ſuruey and inſtrumentall menſuration of a Mannor, or any other ſuperficiall content whatſoeuer, by diuers and ſeuerall meanes; with

            <p>Wherein by the way J would aduiſe the Reader, who deſireth to make vſe thereof, and to profit himſelfe thereby, in reading and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; to take the Chapters before him as they lye in order; for that I haue ſtriued to place them in ſuch an orderly and methodicall forme, as the one neceſſarily follow the other in vſe and practiſe; well knowing that diſorder and irregularitie in this kinde, breedeth not a little trouble and confuſion to the weake practicioner.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Booke, conſiſteth of the <hi>legall part</hi> of Suruey; wherein I firſt ſhew what a Mannor is and the ſeuerall parts thereof, with the appendants thereunto; how the ſame is created and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and how and by what meanes deſtroyed and diſcontinued: alſo the ſeuerall ſorts and kindes of eſtates whereby any lands or tenements may be holden, and the ſeuerall tenures, rents and ſeruices depending on thoſe eſtates: I further ſhew therein the order and manner of keeping Courts of Suruey, with the entrie of the tenants euidence and eſtates; and the orderly and artificiall manner of ingroſsing the ſame, with many other neceſſary rules and obſeruations tending to thoſe purpoſes, as more at large alſo appeareth by the argument of the ſame Booke.</p>
            <p>And here, as before, would I aduiſe the practicioner, to obſerue the like courſe in reading and practiſing the rules and inſtructions of this Booke, as I haue formerly directed for the third, for that J haue ſtrictly obſerued the like decorum in placing the Chapters each after other, as of neceſsity they are to be vſed and practiſed.</p>
            <p>Now might I here much inlarge and protend this Preface, in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wonderfull vſe of the two former Bookes, in the performance of infinite concluſions Geometricall, ſo farre paſsing this ſubiect of Suruey, as it in it ſelfe exceedeth the meaneſt matter of diſpoſe, which (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide prolixitie) J will here forbeare, leauing the conſideration thereof to thine owne iudgement, when thou ſhalt finde therein by thy diligent practiſe the ſweet and pleaſing taſte of ſuch ſenſe-beguiling fruit.</p>
            <p>And further might I amplifie the ſame, not only in declaring the great and infinite pleaſure, with no leſſe profit, which the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vſe, and vnderſtanding of the two later Books may bring (aſwell to Surueyors, as all owners and occupyers of land in generall) but alſo of the antiquitie and neceſsitie of Suruey; howſoeuer ſleighted by many, who will not beſtow a penny in points, or two pence in tape, or the like, but they will number the one, and meaſure the other, before they pay for
<pb facs="tcp:16637:6"/>either, and yet will disburſe manie thouſands in a purchaſe, without the certaine knowledge of either quantitie, qualitie, or value thereof: (and theſe are thoſe which are called penny-wiſe, &amp;c.) whereby it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens (as I haue often knowne) that a valuable purchaſe being made, within few weekes after, the money hath beene raiſed of the woods, and the lands perhaps immediately ſold for much more then the money dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed; and the ſame againe vented at the third hand, hath yeelded a double value: and all this vnſeene, and vnſurueyed, with what diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the firſt vendor, I will leaue to the conſideration of my young Maſter, who hath thus offended in ſelling all, and reſteth now in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with full reſolution not to offend in the like. And the like haue I knowne of a purchaſe made, when a moitie of the charge could ſcarcely be raiſed.</p>
            <p>But to ſpend time to this purpoſe, were to little end, and therefore will I end this purpoſe; only intreating thee gentle Reader, that as I haue thus imployed mine idle houres, to find thee houres of imployment; if thou reape either pleaſure or profit by theſe my paines, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord me thy good opinion (for <hi>Virtus laudata creſcit, &amp; honos alit artes</hi>) which is all I craue.</p>

But, leſt this relation ſhould be held digreſſion, lets returne to the purpoſe. This Table it ſelfe is diuided into fiue parts, or ſmall bords, whereof three are in the bredth, and the other two imployed as ledges in the length, to keepe the reſt together, whereunto a ioynted frame is artificially applyed, for the faſtning and keeping playne thereon, an ordinarie ſheet of paper for vſe in the fields; of which length and bredth, or rather leſſe, as 14½· inches in length, and 11. in bredth, the whole Table together ſhould conſiſt. But for my purpoſe, I would haue made of theſe three boords in bredth, with helpe of ledges, to be thereon glued, to the back-ſide thereof, and ſtrong ioynts or gemmowes, faſtning them together, an artificiall boxe; which at any inſtant being opened, and the ledges faſtned on, is fit for vſe in the Fields, and afterwards thoſe ledges taken away, may be as inſtantly turned back wards, and incloſed as before, fit for the keeping of looſe papers and ſmall tooles, till further occaſion. Which if any deſire to vſe, <hi>M. Iohn Thomſon</hi> in <hi>Hoſier</hi>-Lane, will artificially fit him. To this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument doth alſo belong a Ruler with two fights thereon, which by diuers men are vſed of diuers kindes, but by the beſt Playne Table men (as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerues) thoſe of M. IOHN GOODWYNS <hi>inuention, that excellent and honeſt Artiſt, whoſe liuing Name (though himſelfe be dead) I cannot remember without good reſpect.</hi> This Ruler is to contayne in length about 16. inches, or as long or longer then the table, for drawing parallel lines on the paper faſtned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the equall and oppoſite diuiſions on the frame; it is likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne in bredth about two inches or vpwards, and in thicknes halfe an inch; the ſights thereof are double in length the one to the other, the longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning about 12. inches, and the ſhorter halfe as much; on the head or top
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16637:70"/>of which ſhorter ſight, muſt be placed a wyer or braſſe pin; and to this ſight there muſt be faſtned a thred and plummet, to place the Inſtrument Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; through the longer ſight muſt be made a ſlit, extending almoſt the whole length of the ſight. Theſe two ſights thus prepared, are to be placed perpendicularly on the Ruler, by ſquare morteſſes, made to that purpoſe through the ſame, in ſuch ſort as the braſſe pin on the ſhorter ſight, and the ſlit through the longer ſight, be preciſely ouer the fiduciall edge of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; either ſight being equi-diſtantly placed from each end of the Ruler, and the ſpace betweene the ſights to be exactly the iuſt length of the longer ſight, or to ſpeake more properly of the diuided part of the ſame ſight; <hi>(which is alwayes to be vnderſtood when I ſpeake of the length thereof.)</hi> Vpon this longer ſight there is to be placed a vane of braſſe, to be remoued vp or downe at pleaſure; through which a ſmall ſight hole is to be made, anſwerable to the ſlit in the ſame ſight, and the edge of the vane.</p>
               <p>By theſe ſights thus placed on the Ruler, there is proiected a Geometrical ſquare, whoſe ſide is the diuided part of the long ſight, or the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two ſights. In the middle of which long ſight, ouerthwart the ſame, there is drawne a line called the line of leuell, diuiding the ſide of the proiected ſquare into two equall parts, alſo the ſame ſide is on this ſight di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into 100. equall parts, which are numbred vpwards and downewards, from the line of leuell, by fiues and tens to 50. on either ſide, which diuiſions are called the Scale.</p>
               <p>There is alſo on the ſame ſight expreſſed another ſort of diuiſion, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Hypothenuſall lines of the ſame ſquare, as they increaſe by vnits, and are likewiſe numbred vpwards and downewards from the line of leuel, from one to 12. as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. ſignifying 101, 102, 103, &amp;c. which declare how much an Hypothenuſall or ſlope line, drawne ouer the ſame ſquare (that is, from the pinnes head to any ſuch diuiſion) exceedeth the direct horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall line, being the ſide of the ſame ſquare.</p>
               <p>There is moreouer a third ſort of diuiſions on this ſight, repreſenting the degrees of a quadrant (or as many as can well be expreſſed on the ſame ſight being 25.) which are (as thoſe before) numbred, from the line of leuell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downewards, by fiues and tens to 25. which diuiſions are called the quadrant.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there may be placed on the ſurface, or vpper part of this Ruler, the table of Synes, mentioned in the deſcription of the Circumferentor, next hereafter following; very neceſſary for vſe, as ſhall hereafter partly appeare.</p>
               <p>Yet would I further aduiſe concerning this Inſtrument; that in playne and leuell grounds, where is no vſe of reducing Hypothenuſall lines; inſtead of thoſe long ſights formerly expreſſed, to haue vſed ſuch double ſights as are hereafter mentioned in the deſcription of the <hi>Peractor,</hi> which are farre more readie, and leſſe cumberſome for vſe, eſpecially in rough and boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous weather. And likewiſe, when occaſion ſhall be offered, by irregular and vn-euen grounds, to reduce thoſe Hypothenuſall lines, to vſe in ſtead of thoſe long ſights, the quadrant hereafter likewiſe ſpecified in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which when need requires may be eaſily fixed to the Ruler; and as ſoone laid by, hauing no further vſe, for of all other meanes in taking of heights, and eſpecially for reducing of thoſe Hypothenuſall lines, I hold
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16637:70"/>that quadrant artificially handled to be moſt readie and exact, all concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being ſpeedily wrought therewith without Arithmetick, or other colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall computation whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Inſtrument belongeth diuers other ordinary parts, whereof I ſhall not neede particularly to ſpeake, ſeeing moſt men (if not too many) already know them, being of ordinarie vſe; as the Socket, the Boxe and Needle with the ſtaffe or foote thereof, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>About the middle in the ſurface thereof, a round hole is to be turned of the depth of halfe an inch, whereof the Diameter to be about 3½· inches, to place a carde and needle therein, to be couered ouer with cleere glaſſe.

               <p>There is alſo hereunto belonging two ſights, double in length, the one vnto the other, the longer contayning about ſeuen inches or vpwards, being placed, and diuided in all reſpects, as thoſe formerly mentioned in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the playne Table; the ſhorter ſight of theſe hauing one proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vſe, which that (as needleſſe) hath not, being this, in the edge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, towards the vpper part is placed a ſmall wyer, repreſenting the center of a ſuppoſed circle, the ſemidiameter whereof is that part of the ſame ſight, betweene the wyer, and a perpendicular point on the edge of the Inſtrument vnderneath the ſame; which part is imagined to be diuided into 60. equall parts, and according to thoſe diuiſions is the right edge of the Inſtrument, diuided and numbred from the perpendicular point by fiues and tens, as 5.10.15. &amp;c. And alſo from the ſame point on the ſurface and vpper edge of the Inſtrument is perfected, the degrees of a Quadrant ſupplying the reſidue of thoſe which could not be expreſſed on the long ſight from 25, to 90. by tens, &amp;c. For the vſe of theſe Diuiſions is there alſo belonging hereunto an Index or ſmall Rule, at the one end whereof is a Centre hole to place on the Wyer in the edge of the ſhorter ſight, and at the other end a ſight is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, anſwerable to the fiduciall edge of the ſame Index, which edge is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diuided according to thoſe diuiſions on the edge of the Inſtrument. This ſhort ſight is to haue a plummet of lead hanging in a fine thred, ſeruing to place the Inſtrument horizontally. Where note, that theſe ſights, and their ſeuerall diuiſions ſerue onely for Altitudes, Profundities, and the reducing of Hypothenuſall lines to horizontall, which is to excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and full of vſe. But when there is no occaſion or vſe of theſe (as ſeldome there is in reſpect of other vſe) I would alwayes haue ready, ſuch double ſights as are hereafter expreſſed in the deſcription of the <hi>Peractor,</hi> which doubtleſſe are of excellent vſe, as I there explaine; with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you alwayes carefully keepe one and the ſame part of your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forwards, and reccon euer your degrees in one and the ſame end of your Needle.</p>
               <p>The foot of this Inſtrument is that with three ſtaues ioynted in the head,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16637:71"/>and to be taken a ſunder in the middle with braſſe ſockets, according to the vſuall order, moſt fitte for all Inſtruments, except in ſuch caſes, as in the deſcription of the <hi>Peractor</hi> is excepted.

It conſiſteth of a <hi>Planiſphere</hi> in braſſe, much like vnto that of the Theodelite, but where the limbe of that is diuided into 360. parts or degrees; this is only into 120. (ſo that each of theſe containeth three of thoſe) and theſe ſubdeuided into halfes and quarters towards the limbe thereof, without which diuiſions, there are drawne and deſcribed three concentricke Circles, being croſſed with Diagonals, by whoſe interſections are exactly expreſſed the third part of euery degree; whereby, and by tripling the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer degrees cut (if occaſion require) is had exactly the degrees of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odelite conſidering that ten of theſe contain thirty of thoſe, wherewith in matter of Suruey we ſhall little need to trouble our ſelues. <hi>And here haue we large and ſpacious degrees with their exact parts to</hi> ¼· <hi>(which in others wee want) by meanes whereof, and with helpe of ſuch a chaine, as I alwayes vſe (which ſhall be next hereafter expreſſed) I will boldly approue and maintaine, to worke with much more facilitie and exactnes, and come neerer the preciſe truth then any other can poſsibly doe, not vſing the ſame or the like, which will appeare moſt manifeſt in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to all mens vnderſtanding.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The making and diuiſion of a Chaine, called the Decimall Chaine.</head>

In the diuiding whereof it is to bee conſidered, that the ſtatute Perch or Pole, (which here we call an vnite, or <hi>(Comencemente)</hi> containeth in length 16 ½ feete. which is, 198. ynches: This quantitie is firſt to be diuided into 10. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts called <hi>Primes,</hi> ſo ſhall euery of theſe <hi>Primes</hi> containe in length 19. ynches, and ⅘· of an ynch: And then theſe <hi>Primes</hi> to bee euery of them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16637:73"/>ſubdiuided into other 10. equall parts, which wee will call <hi>Seconds:</hi> and ſo euery of theſe <hi>Seconds</hi> ſhall containe in length one ynch, and 49/50· parts of an ynch. And thus is the whole Perch <hi>vnite</hi> or comencement diuided into 100. equall parts or linkes called <hi>Seconds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Chaine ſo diuided is thus to bee diſtinguiſhed and marked: Firſt, at the end of euery fifth Prime, or fiftieth <hi>ſecond</hi> or lincke, which is the end of euery halfe Pole, let a large curtaine ring be faſtned, ſo ſhall you haue in the whole Chaine (if but two Poles) three of thoſe rings; the middlemoſt being the diuiſion of the two Poles, which in a Chaine of this length is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily diſcerned from thoſe rings of the halfe Poles, though all of one greatnes. Then at the end of euery <hi>Prime,</hi> that is, at the end of euery tenth <hi>ſecond,</hi> or linke, let a ſmall curtaine ring be placed, and not thoſe rings of braſſe wyer, as is vſuall in other chaines, which, with euery buſh and twig are continually broken off, and loſt.</p>
               <p>By thoſe diſtinctions this Chaine is now diuided into theſe three termes, <hi>Vnites, Primes</hi> and <hi>Seconds,</hi> whoſe Characters are theſe 0.1.2. So that if you would expreſſe 26. <hi>Vnites,</hi> 4. <hi>Primes,</hi> and 5. <hi>Seconds,</hi> they are thus to be written 26<seg rend="above">0</seg>· 4<seg rend="above">1</seg>· 5<seg rend="above">2</seg>· or together thus, 26<seg rend="above">0</seg> 4<seg rend="above">1</seg> 5<seg rend="above">2</seg>· or more briefly thus, 26 4<seg rend="above">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Statute of 33. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. It was ordained that an Acre of ground ſhould containe 160. ſquare Perches, to be meaſured by the Pole of 16½· feete, which is the meaſure now receyued, and generally allowed of, and is commonly called Statute-meaſure: yet notwithſtanding in many places of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there are diuers other ſorts retayned and claimed as cuſtomary, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are greater, and ſome leſſe then that by Statute. Wherefore I hold it very fitting, and a maine point belonging to a Surueyor, readily to reduce theſe quantities from the one to the other, whereby the difference may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; whereof in practiſe hee ſhall find often vſe; which to effect worke thus. Suppoſe there are 5. Acres, 2. Roodes, 20.

Acres, 2. Roodes, 20. Perches, be 900. Perches. And conſidering that the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the ſquare of 12. bears to the ſquare of 11. the like proportion beares the Acre of 18. foot Pole to that of 16 ½· therefore ſquare thoſe two termes 12. and 11. which produceth 144. and 121. then multiply the giuen quantitie 900. Perches by 144 the greater ſquare (becauſe the greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure 18. is to be reduced into the leſſer 16 ½· the Factus is 129600. which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by the leſſer ſquare 121. quoteth 1071 9/121· Perches; which reduced into Acres, is 6. Acres, 2. Roodes, 31. Perches, and 9/121· parts of a Perch; for the quantitie required in ſtatute meaſure, whoſe difference by deducting that from this, appeareth to be 1. Acre, 0. Roode, 11. Perches 9/121·</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the giuen quantitie had beene ſtatute meaſure, and the ſame required to be reduced into Wood-land meaſure; then ſhould you haue multiplied the 900. Perches giuen by 121. the leſſer ſquare (becauſe the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer meaſure 16½· were to be reduced into the greater 18.) whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

Perches be meaſured in a right line with the 18. foote pole, the ſame length containeth 12. Perches meaſured with the 16½ foote pole. But if you are conſtrained in the meaſuring of your Wood-lands, to vſe the Pole of 18. foot; then muſt you protract and lay downe the ſame in your plat by the Scale of 11. which otherwiſe will not ioyne with your other works; and the ſame likewiſe to be caſt vp by the ſame Scale of 11. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

C. and on the ſide B C. of that Angle, place by your Scale the length of your ſecond line R Q. 12<seg rend="above">0</seg>· 5<seg rend="above">1</seg>· from B. to C. and on the point C. where your laſt length ended, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract another Angle, equall to the Angle R Q L. your third Angle taken, as the Angle B C D. and on the ſide C D. extended, place the length of your third line L Q. 14<seg rend="above">0</seg>· 9<seg rend="above">1</seg>· from C. to D. And ſo proceede from Angle to Angle, protracting your Angles equal (and in order by the number of lines) to thoſe anſwerable in your concentricke Circles, and laying downe duly by your Scale on each line, the length thereunto belonging, you ſhall produce the Figure A B C D E F G H I. like vnto the meaſured quantitie.</p>
               <p>And hauing thus finiſhed; if you doubt or make queſtion, whether you haue wrought exactly or not, and deſire to be reſolued therein, make appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thus. Collect the quantitie of all your Angles in your whole worke, and adding them together, note the totall thereof; which in this former worke is 1260. then multiply 180. (the number of degrees in a Semicircle) by a number leſſe by 2. then the number of Angles in your worke,<note place="margin">If your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be thoſe of 120. as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the Peractor, or Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferentor, then in ſtead of 180. you muſt take 60.</note> which here is 7. (for the number of Angles is 9. as appeareth by the line O Q. which ſheweth the number of the laſt line, and conſequently of the Angles) and if the product of that multiplication agree with the former totall; then by THEOR. 74.1. you haue done rightly, otherwiſe not; as the Product of 180. by 7. is 1260. agreeing with your firſt number; and therefore may you confidently affirme to haue wrought exactly, which rule is generall for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plottes, and ſuperficiall figures whatſoeuer.</p>

Wherefore ſuppoſe that the figure or Diagram there expreſſed, were a Mannor, or part of a Mannor to bee meaſured and plotted. Firſt, write your Title, as there is mentioned then planting your Inſtrument in A. direct your ſight to B. and hauing obſerued the degree there cut, take vp your Inſtrument, and meaſure to B. entring your degree and length into your booke, then plant not your Inſtrument at B. but onely meaſure from thence to C. and there place your Inſtrument, &amp; direct ypur ſight backwards to B. obſeruing your degree; but with this ſpeciall regard, that in taking your backe ſights, you alwayes reckon the degree cut by one and the ſame end of the Index, as you reckon on, when you direct your ſight forwards; or otherwiſe you take the oppoſite degree to that you ſhould, which will much trouble you in protraction: then here conſider, that you are to leaue the bounder, which you went againſt from A. where you began, to this place, &amp; therfore draw a ſingle line, and as you are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16637:93"/>there taught, write the bounder paſt, as in the example of your booke; then direct your ſight to D. and obſeruing your degree, meaſure thither, which hauing entred, make there another ſingle line, for that here you leaue that bounder alſo, which let be expreſſed; then meaſure from D. to E. and there plant your Inſtrument, and as before direct your ſight backewards to D. and obſerue the degree with the former caution, which done, turne your ſight to F. and hauing your degree, meaſure from E. to F. and likewiſe from F. to G. expreſſing in your Booke thoſe lengthes ſeuerally, then plant your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument at G. and taking your degree from thence backwards to F. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, here ſtrike a ſingle line, and write your third bounder, then take your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to H. and meaſure thither, where alſo (that being your laſt Angle) you muſt plant your Inſtrument, and worke as before to A. where you began, and then ſtrike a double line, ſignifying you haue finiſhed that Field.

But thoſe being of particular figures, are not ſo meet or neceſſarie for the Reduction or tranſlation of a plot conſiſting of many (being often in vſe.) Wherefore I will here deliuer you a very ſpeedie and exact meanes for the performance thereof. According to the proportion whereunto you would reduce your firſt plot, lay papers together with mouth-glue; as if you would reduce it into a fourth part, make your new plot to be in quantitie a fourth part thereof. Then place your new made plot on your rough plot in ſuch ſort, and with ſuch diſcretion, as the middle of the one may be about the middle of the other, whereby all the worke of the one may be reduced the better into the other, and there faſten the one to the other ſlenderly at the corners with mouth-glue, in ſuch ſort, as when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerueth, any one of thoſe glued places may be eaſily taken aſunder, and the paper folded in; then take your reducing ruler mentioned in Chap. 9. and faſten the ſame with a needle or blue pin ſtriken into the table about the middle of the plots through the centre hole of the ſame rule, in ſuch maner as both the plots together may bee turned about at pleaſure vpon the table; wherein you muſt take great care of renting or tearing out your centre point in the plots; which to preuent, would require to bee ſtrengthened with a ſmall piece of a Carde or paſt-boord, to bee glued thereon, vnderneath the firſt plot. And being thus prepared, you ſhall finde good part of the worke in your firſt plot, to lye without the vtter edges of your cleane paper, which let be firſt reduced; wherein (hauing reſolued into what proportion you will make your Reduction, as into ¼· of the firſt) worke thus; bring the edge of your Ruler to any Angle in your firſt plot, and note what number of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion on the edge of your Ruler is there cut, which admit 40. then take halfe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16637:99"/>therof which is 20. and againſt that diuiſion by the edge of your Ruler make a pricke on your cleane paper, then remoue your Ruler to the next Angle in your firſt plot, and note the diuiſion there cut, whereof take likewiſe the halfe, and againſt that halfe by the edge of the Ruler make another prick; and betweene theſe two prickes draw a line, which ſhall repreſent the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thoſe two Angles of your firſt plot; and ſo proceede from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to Angle, and from Cloſe to Cloſe, till you haue reduced all the worke on your olde plot, lying without the edges of the new, or ſo much as lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame towards any one ſide or corner thereof; and then vngluing one of your corners or ſides, fold in backwards towards your olde plot, that part of your new plot as is wrought; ſo ſhall you come to worke that which formerly lay vnder the ſame; and thus by folding in, and working one ſide after another to the centre; whilſt the other ſides are faſtned together with the olde plot, you ſhall ſpeedily reduce the whole plot into your deſired proportion: For in taking the halfe of euery line in your firſt plot your new by THEOR. 49.1. ſhall be ¼ of the olde.</p>

                  <p>FEe ſimple of all other eſtates is the moſt large, ample, and abſolute that wee haue in this Kingdome,<note place="margin">Deſined.</note> or that can by our Lawes bee inueſted or made; and is that which is granted to any man and his heyres for euer, without any further or other limitation of vſe or vſes; and therefore if ſuch Tenant hath iſſue of his bodie, the land deſcendeth to him, if not, to the next of kinne within the degrees of limitation hereafter ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>But if a man purchaſe in Fee-ſimple to him and his aſſignes for euer, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this word heyres; here hath he but an eſtate for terme of life; for heires is the word which carrieth the inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is otherwiſe if lands be ſo deuiſed by Will; for the Law intendeth that learned counſell cannot alwaies be preſent in ſuch caſes; and therefore is ſuch deuiſe conſtrued for the beſt, according to the Teſtators meaning and intention, and not to the ſtrict letter of the Will.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if Lands be granted to any man with a woman in Franke-marriage, this word implyeth an eſtate of inheritance without mention or addition of the word Heyres; Or to a man and to his bloud the like.</p>
                  <p>And here is to bee conſidered, who are thoſe which are ſaid to bee within the degrees of limitation before ſpoken of; that is, who are vnderſtood to be a mans heires by the common Law. Suppoſe A. B. dieth ſeiſed of a ſtate of inheritance without iſſue of his bodie: Neither his brother, or ſifter of the halfe bloud,<note place="margin">The halfe bloud. Abaſtard no beire. Lineall and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later all deſcent.</note> nor their iſſue ſhall be his heyre; nor his baſtard; nor his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, grandfather, or grandmother; for inheritance may lineally or collaterally deſcend, but by no meanes lineally aſcend by our Lawes; but the brother or ſiſter of the father of A.B. (which is called a collateral deſcent) ſhal be his heyre; and then they dying ſeiſed without iſſue, the father of A.B. ſhall haue the land as heyre to his vncle or aunt, but not as heyre vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe it is to be vnderſtood, that by the lawes of this Realme the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne is wholly to inherite; and he dying without iſſue, the ſecond ſon, and ſo of the reſt;<note place="margin">Coparceners.</note> and if no ſonnes but daughters, they ſhall ioyntly inherite as coparceners; but if no iſſue neither ſonne nor daughter, then ſhall the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt brother be heyre, for want of ſuch all the ſiſters; and in default of them, the vncle by the fathers ſide, if the Land came by the father, or bee of the purchaſe of him ſo deceaſed: But if there be no heyre of the fathers ſide, the purchaſed lands goe to thoſe of the mothers ſide; But if none ſuch, then all thoſe lands ſhall Eſcheate to the Lord of whom they are holden.<note place="margin">Eſcheate.</note>

Whereof in order as followeth.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Knights ſeruice.</head>
                  <p>THis tenure of Knights ſeruice includeth Homage and Fealtie, and commonly Eſcuage; and whoſo holdeth any lands or tenements by this ſeruice, is bound by the Lawes of this our Realme, to doe vnto his Lord Homage and Fealtie;<note place="margin">Homage.</note> being a ſeruice of the greateſt humilitie and reſpect, that can be performed by a tenant vnto his Lord: and for the moſt part, he is to pay Eſcuage, called <hi>Scutagium,</hi> that is, ſeruice of ſhield; which is to be aſſeſſed by authoritie of Parliament, as ſhall be hereafter declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How the tenant ſhall doe homage</note>When the tenant ſhall doe homage to his Lord, the Lord ſhall ſit, and the tenant kneeling downe before him, on both his knees, and holding both his hands betweene his Lords hands, ſhall ſay thus: I become your man, from henceforth, of life and member, and of earthly honor, and to you will be faithfull and true, and faith to you ſhall beare for the lands I hold of you (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing my faith which I owe and beare vnto our Soueraigne Lord the King) and then the Lord ſo ſitting, ſhall kiſſe him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How fealtie is to be done.</note>Fealtie is as much to ſay, as <hi>Fidelitas,</hi> or fidelitie. In doing whereof, the tenant ſhall lay his right hand on a booke, and ſay thus: I will be vnto you my Lord, faithfull and true, and faith to you ſhall beare, for the lands and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements which I claime to hold of you, and duly ſhall doe and performe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the cuſtomes and ſeruices which I ought to doe, at the termes aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as helpe me God; <hi>and then he ſhall kiſſe the booke.</hi> And it is to be noted, that <hi>Homage</hi> muſt be done vnto the Lord himſelfe perſonally; but <hi>Fealtie</hi> may be made to the Steward of the Court, or to the Baylife thereof. Alſo, tenant for terme of life ſhall doe <hi>Fealtie,</hi> but not <hi>Homage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What dutie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>As concerning Eſcuage: hee that holdeth his lands by a whole fee of Knights ſeruice; when the King goes in perſon to the warres, he is bound to be with him by the ſpace of fortie dayes, ſufficiently appointed for the warres: and he that holdeth by the moitie of the fee of Knights ſeruice, is bound by his tenure to be with the King in ſuch ſort as before, by the ſpace of twentie daies; and ſo proportionally, according to the quantitie and rate of his tenure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:16637:107"/>And it is to be vnderſtood, that after the Kings returne from the warres, a Parliament is vſually called;<note place="margin">Parliament.</note> by authoritie whereof, it is aſſeſſed, what and how much, in money, euerie man that holdeth by a whole fee of Knights ſeruice (who was neyther perſonally, nor any man for him, with the King) ſhall pay vnto the Lord of whome he holdeth his land, by Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuage: and according to ſuch aſſeſſement, euerie tenant ſhall pay to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Lord,<note place="margin">What Eſcuage to be paid.</note> after the rate and proportion of his tenure: and this money thus aſſeſſed, is called <hi>Scutage,</hi> or <hi>Eſcuage;</hi> for which, the Lord vnto whom the ſame is due, may diſtraine for non-payment thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome tenants by cuſtome,<note place="margin">Cuſtome.</note> are not otherwiſe bound, but to pay a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or third part of what ſhall be aſſeſſed, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>And in ſome places the cuſtome is, that whatſoeuer be aſſeſſed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet their Eſcuage is certaine, and they pay neither more nor leſſe, but ſuch a ſumme of money,<note place="margin">Eſcuage certaine</note> as fiue ſhillings, or the like; and this is called <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuage certaine:</hi> and this tenure is Socage tenure, and not Knights ſeruice; the <hi>Eſcuage</hi> whereof is alwayes vncertaine, and ſo called. And this <hi>Eſcuage vncertaine</hi> (belonging alwayes to Knights ſeruice) draweth vnto it Ward, Marriage, and Reliefe, as hereafter appeareth.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>2.</hi> Ward, Marriage, and Reliefe.</head>
                  <p>AS formerly appeareth, Knights ſeruice (the tenure laſt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) draweth vnto it <hi>Ward, Marriage,</hi> and <hi>Reliefe;</hi> and therefore I hold it fitting here next to treat thereof. Wherefore, firſt it is to be vnderſtood, that if a man hold any lands or tenements by this tenure, and dieth, his heire male being within the age of one and twentie yeares; the Lord of whome thoſe lands are holden, ſhall haue the <hi>Ward,</hi> that is, the cuſtodie and keeping of thoſe lands ſo holden of him,<note place="margin">Ward.</note> to his owne vſe and behoofe, without account, vntill the heire come to the full age of one and twentie yeares: for it is intended by the Law, that vntill he attaine to that age, he is not fit or able to performe ſuch ſeruice, as by this tenure is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>And if at the time of the death of ſuch tenant the heire be vnmarried,<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> the Lord ſhall not onely haue the wardſhip of his bodie and lands, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of him in marriage.</p>
                  <p>And if a tenant by Knights ſeruice die, and leaue an heire female, being of the age of foureteene yeares,<note place="margin">Heire female.</note> or vpwards; then the Lord ſhall not haue the ward of ſuch heire,<note place="margin">The full age of a woman.</note> neyther of her bodie nor lands; becauſe a woman of that age may haue a husband able to performe the ſeruices required by this tenure.</p>
                  <p>But if ſuch an heire be vnder that age of foureteene yeares, and vnmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the time of her anceſtors death, then ſhall the Lord haue the ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of her lands ſo holden of him, till ſhe attaine to the age of ſixteene yeares; by force of an act of Parliament, in the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And note here the great difference betweene the ages of Males and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16637:107"/>for the Female hath theſe ſeuerall ages appointed vnto her by the Law. Firſt,<note place="margin">Diuerſitie of the ages of women.</note> at ſeuen yeeres of age the Lord her father may diſtrayne his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for aide to marry her. Secondly, at nine yeeres of age ſhee is dowable. Thirdly, at twelue yeeres of age ſhee is held able to aſſent to matrimonie: Fourthly, at foureteene ſhe is able to haue her land, and ſhall be out of ward, (if ſhee be of this age at the death of her anceſtor.) Fiftly, at ſixteene ſhee ſhall be out of Ward, though ſhee were vnder foureteene yeeres of age at the death of her anceſtor: and ſixtly, at one and twentie yeeres ſhee is able to make alienations of her lands or tenements.<note place="margin">Mens ages.</note> But the Law limiteth to the Male, only two ages, that is, at fourteene yeeres to haue his lands holden in Socage: and at one and twentie to make alienations.</p>
                  <p>As concerning <hi>Reliefe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reliefe.</note> if a man hold his lands by Knights ſeruice and dyeth, his heire male being of the age of one and twentie yeeres, or his heire female of the age of fourteene yeeres, the Lord of whom ſuch lands are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſhall haue <hi>reliefe</hi> of the heire.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is to be noted, that all Earles, Barons, or other the Kingstenants (holding of him in chiefe by Knights ſeruice) if they dye, their heire being of full age, as aforeſaid, they ought to pay the old reliefe for their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">What reliefes are to be paid, and how.</note> that is, the heire of an Earle for a whole Earledom an hundred pounds; the heire of a Baron for a whole Baronie a hundred markes; the heire of a Knight fiue pounds, and he that hath leſſe ſhall giue leſſe, according to the old cuſtome of Fees. And the like is to be vnderſtood and obſerued of all others, that hold ſuch lands immediately of any other Lord.</p>
                  <p>And alſo a man may hold lands of a Lord by two Knights fees, and then the heire being of full age at the death of his anceſtor, ſhall pay to his Lord for reliefe ten pounds.</p>

                  <p>IT is alſo to be vnderſtood, that a man may hold lands by Knights ſeruice,<note place="margin">Defined.</note> and not by eſcuage, nor pay eſcuage for the ſame: But hee may hold by <hi>Caſtle garde,</hi> which is to keepe a tower or ſome other place of his Lords Caſtle, on a reaſonable warning, when the Lord heareth of the approch of his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>This is likewiſe Knights ſeruice, and draweth thereunto ward, marriage and reliefe, in all reſpects as the common Knights ſeruice doth, before mentioned.</p>

                  <p>And if a man hold land of the King by <hi>grand Sergeantie,</hi> and dye; his heire being of full age, then ſhall his heire pay vnto the King, not only fiue pounds, as he that holdeth by eſcuage, but alſo the cleere yeerely value of ſuch lands, as he ſhall hold by <hi>grand Sergeantie.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <note place="margin">Diuerſitie of Rents.</note> another <hi>Rent charge,</hi> and a third <hi>Rent ſeck,</hi> or <hi>Redditus ſiccus,</hi> a drie rent.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rent ſeruice.</note>As concerning <hi>rent ſeruice,</hi> it fitly hath the name, for that it is vſually
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16637:109"/>tyed and knit to the tenure; and is, as it were, a ſeruice, whereby a man hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his lands or tenements, or at leaſt, when the rents are vnſeparably cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and knit with the ſeruice. As for example; where the tenant holdeth his land of the Lord by fealtie and certaine rent, or by homage, fealtie, and by certaine rent, or by any other kind of ſeruice and certaine rent, this rent is called <hi>rent ſeruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diſtreſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right.</note>And here is to be noted, that if at any time this <hi>rent ſeruice</hi> be behind and vnpaid, the Lord of whome the lands or tenements are holden, whether in fee ſimple, fee tayle, for terme of life, for yeares, or at will, may of common right enter and diſtraine for the rent, though there be no mention at all, nor clauſe of Diſtreſſe put in the Deed or Leaſe.</p>
               <p>The nature of this <hi>rent ſeruice</hi> I ſay is to be coupled and knit to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; and therefore, where no tenure is, there can be no <hi>rent ſeruice:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if at this day I be ſeiſed of lands or tenements in fee ſimple, and make a Deed of Feoffement thereof vnto another in fee ſimple, and reſerue by the ſame Deed a rent, this can be called no <hi>rent ſeruice;</hi> for that there can be now no tenure betweene the Feoffor and Feoffee. But it is otherwiſe of Feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores terrarum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anno 18. Ed. 1.</note> formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For before the making of that Statute, if any man had made a Feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee ſimple, and had reſerued thereon vnto himſelfe a certaine rent, although it had beene without Deed, here had beene created a new tenure betweene the Feoffor and Feoffee, and the Feoffee muſt haue holden of the Feoffor, who by meanes thereof, might of common right haue diſtrained for ſuch rent: but ſince the time of that Statute, there can be no ſuch holding or tenure created or begun; and conſequently,<note place="margin">No rent ſeruice can be now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued on gift in fee.</note> no <hi>rent ſeruice</hi> can at this day be reſerued vpon any gift in fee ſimple; except in the Kings caſe; who being chiefe Lord of all, may, and euer might, giue lands to be holden of him.</p>
               <p>Thus it is apparant, that at this day no ſubiect can reſerue any <hi>rent ſeruice</hi> vnto himſelfe, vnleſſe the reuerſion of thoſe lands, ſo by him graunted, be ſtill in himſelfe: as where hee graunteth them in fee tayle, or maketh but a leaſe for terme of life, or for yeares, or elſe at will; for in all theſe caſes, the reuerſion of the fee ſimple remaineth ſtill in him: wherefore, if any rent be here reſerued, it is to be called <hi>a rent ſeruice;</hi> and of common right is diſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, although there be no clauſe of Diſtreſſe compriſed in the Deed or Leaſe.</p>
               <p>And if a man ſhall abſolutely and wholly graunt away in fee ſimple anie lands or tenements by him ſo holden, leauing no reuerſion thereof in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and yet ſhall reſerue vnto himſelfe in his Graunt an annuall rent; with a clauſe of Diſtreſſe in his Deed indented, That it ſhall be lawfull for him to diſtraine for the ſame, if need require; this rent (in regard, that the land is therewith charged) is called <hi>a rent charge:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rent charge.</note> But hee cannot diſtraine for this rent of common right, as before for the other, but onely by force and vertue of his Deed indented.</p>
               <p>And if there be no ſuch clauſe of Diſtreſſe contained in the Deed, then is this rent ſo reſerued called <hi>a rent ſeck.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rent ſeck.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, if a man ſtanding ſeiſed of lands and tenements in fee ſimple, will graunt either by Indenture, or poll Deed, an yearely rent vnto another, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16637:110"/>out of the ſame lands, whether it be in fee ſimple, fee tayle, for terme of life, for yeares, or at will, with clauſe of Diſtreſſe; then this rent is called a <hi>Rent-charge,</hi> and he vnto whome this rent is graunted, may for default of payment enter and diſtraine.</p>
               <p>And it is further to be vnderſtood, that if a man make a leaſe vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for terme of life, and reſerue thereon vnto himſelfe an yearely rent, and afterwards graunteth that rent vnto A.B. reſeruing the reuerſion of the lands vnto himſelfe;<note place="margin">Rent ſeck.</note> this rent is but a <hi>Rent ſeck:</hi> for that A.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F a Court Baron be kept with your Court of Suruey, as is euer moſt fitting, then are you firſt to enter the ſtile of the Court in this manner.</p>
               <p>Branton. <hi>CVria Baronis &amp; Superuiſ. A. B. Armiger, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tent. die Lunae, videlicet ſecundo die Septem. Anno Regni</hi> IACOBI, <hi>Dei gratia Angliae, Franciae, &amp; Hyberniae Regis fidei defenſ. &amp;c.</hi> xiiij. <hi>&amp; Scotiae</hi> 50. <hi>tent. per A. R. Seneſchallum &amp; Superuiſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the ſtile of the Court thus entred, you ſhall cauſe the Bayliffe, who ſerueth the Court, to make Proclamation by crying once <hi>Oyes,</hi> and then ſhall you will him to ſay, thus; All manner of perſons, who were ſummoned to appeare here this day, to ſerue the Lord of the Mannor, for his Court now holden, draw neere and giue your attendance, and euery one anſwere to his name, as he ſhall be called, vpon the payne and perill that may fall thereon.</p>
               <p>Then by your Rentall, call them all ſeuerally by their names, marking thoſe which are abſent to be amerced. Which done, cauſe the Bayliffe to make another <hi>Oyes,</hi> and willing them to draw neere, and keepe ſilence whilſt the Commiſſion be read; let the ſame be read vnto them, and likewiſe the Articles thereunto annexed, if it be for the King.</p>
               <p>Then out of thoſe tenants which are preſent, make choiſe of the moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for your Iurie, wherein your beſt courſe is, formerly to informe your ſelfe, and to take ſpeciall notice, who are moſt fitting for your purpoſe, and to haue their names readie written in a paper by themſelues, which you may now thereby call accordingly. But being for the King, you haue alwayes a writ of aſſiſtance directed to the Sheriffe of the ſhire, requiring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne you a ſufficient Iurie: yet may you without him by vertue of your Commiſſion, impannell any Iurie at your owne pleaſure. Then direct the Fore-man of the Iurie, to lay his hand on the Booke, and ſweare him as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, or to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>YOu ſhall diligently inquire and make true preſentment of all ſuch matters, as on the Lords behalfe of this Mannor, ſhall be giuen you in charge, you ſhall neither for fauour, feare, affection, or other parciall reſpect whatſoeuer, forbeare to preſent what you ought to finde, or finde what you ought not to preſent, you ſhall herein keepe the Lords counſell, your owne, and your fellowes, and in all things according to a ſincere and vpright conſcience, you ſhall preſent the truth, the whole truth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16637:115"/>but the truth, as by euidence and your owne knowledge you ſhall be induced, to the beſt of your power, ſo helpe you God, and by the contents of the Booke,</hi> which he is to kiſſe.</p>
               <p>And after the Fore-man is thus ſworne by himſelfe, then cauſe three or foure of the reſt of the Iurie, to lay their right hands together on the Booke, and giue them their oath, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe ſame oath which A. B. your Fore-man before you, for his part, hath made and taken, you and euery of you, for your parts ſhall truly keepe and performe to the vttermoſt of your powers, ſo helpe you God.</hi> And cauſe them ſeuerally to kiſſe the Booke.</p>
               <p>And in like manner ſweare all the reſt. And all being ſworne, cauſe the Bayliffe to number them, as you reade their names. Then cauſe him alſo to make the third Proclamation, and ſay thus: All you that be here ſworne, draw neere and hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e your charge, and all the reſt keepe ſilence.</p>
               <p>Then make your exhortation, and deliuer the charge of a Court Baron, after the vſuall manner. Which being finiſhed, you are to addreſſe your ſpeech vnto them, concerning the preſent buſineſſe of Suruey, as occaſion ſhall be offered, whereof to preſcribe you any forme or preſident, were to little purpoſe, ſeeing it is to be framed and directed to ſuch ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as the preſent cauſe requires, which you ſhall alwayes finde different and variable, and therefore I refer the ſame to your owne diſcretion, deeming you now able and fitting ſufficiently to performe the ſame in any kinde.</p>
               <p>And then deliuer vnto them the Articles which you haue readie drawne, according to the directions of the laſt Chapter, which is their charge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the buſineſſe of Suruey, relating vnto them, that as they receiue theſe Articles (whereof they are to inquire) in writing, ſo are they to anſwere the ſame in writing vnder their hands and ſeales particularly by a day, now to be limitted and appointed, which for many reaſons is moſt fitting to be, about the time of your concluding the buſineſſe. Which day is to be expreſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Articles, and your name ſubſcribed thereunto.</p>
               <p>And now are you to take order, and giue ſpeciall directions vnto all the tenants for their attendance, aide, and aſſiſtance, in your inſtrumentall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration, appointing them by turnes, how, when, and where you are to vſe their helpe and aſſiſtance, wherein you are to deale with ſuch diſcretion, as you neither faile of their helpe, when occaſion ſerueth, nor oppreſſe them with grieuance by their ouer-much attendance.</p>
               <p>And hauing thus farre proceeded, the reſt of this day may be ſpent in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their ſeuerall deedes, euidences, and eſtates, in manner as ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after declared.</p>
               <p>But before you diſcharge the tenants, you are to conſider (according to the number of them) in what time or how many dayes, you ſhall be able to enter their eſtates, and if they conſiſt of diuers Towneſhips, as large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lordſhips vſually doe; then your beſt courſe is to appoint them ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16637:116"/>dayes for their attendance, and bringing in of their euidence by ſeuerall Towneſhips, for it would be no leſſe troubleſome to your ſelfe, then diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the tenants, to require their generall and daily attendance vntill the buſineſſe were wholly finiſhed.</p>
               <p>And now may you aiourne the Court vnto the next day, (or ſuch other time as you thinke fitting) by cauſing the Bayliffe to make proclamation to that purpoſe, and the like from time to time, till you haue ended your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p>The next day you may beginne your menſuration in the fields, either by your ſelfe or thoſe whom you imploy to that purpoſe, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the third Booke. But it were fitting for your owne part to be imployed in entering of the tenants eſtates, vntill you haue finiſhed, or you may ſpend ſuch time therein, as when the weather is not fitting to ſtirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or in the mornings and euenings, as you ſhall finde meeteſt for your purpoſe.</p>

Wherefore, I hold it ſitting and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly courſe, that not only euery of thoſe Towneſhips, but the ſeuerall eſtates therein, be entered and taken ſeuerally and particularly by themſelues, that is, all of one and the ſame Towneſhip and eſtate vnder one and the ſame title, for auoyding of confuſion.

               <p>Which being effected, we are firſt to make an Index or alphabetical Table of al the Tenants names; wherunto is to be added the Lords and the Parſons, the one for Demeſnes, the other for gleabe; which Index is thus to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.

               <p>Firſt, take your Field-booke, and beginning where you firſt beganne your worke in the fields, take all the numbers before you expreſſed in the margent thereof, as appeareth in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.3. and noting to what Tenants name they belong in your Field-booke, againſt the ſame name place them in your Index betweene the ruled lines; whereby you ſhall ſpeedily expreſſe and reduce the ſeuerall numbers repreſenting the ſeuerall fields and cloſes throughout the whole Mannor againſt euery mans name in the Index to whom they properly belong.</p>
               <p>Then take your common Field-booke (mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3. and with it performe the like; but make a ſtroke or other marke for diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe and the former numbers; ſo haue you alſo euerie mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parcels lying in the common fields expreſſed againſt his name. And thus is your Index perfect and fit to be imployed as followeth.</p>
               <p>Take now your rough Booke of entries, and turne to the firſt Tenants particular therein entred; and looke in your Index what numbers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Tenant; alſo take your Field-booke, and comparing thoſe numbers in your Index with the ſame in the margent of your Field-booke, you ſhall find therein the ſeuerall names of the fields and cloſes belonging to that Tenant; and the like names ſhall you find in your Booke of entries, in that Tenants particular: wherefore expreſſe thoſe ſeuerall numbers againſt euerie particular parcell in the margent of your entries, whereunto they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16637:118"/>belong: and the like performe in all reſpects with your common field-booke, for thoſe parcels lying in the common fields. Then lay your rough plot before you, and finding thoſe ſeuerall numbers in your plot, note the ſeuerall content and quantitie of euery ſeuerall parcell of ground, expreſſed in the plot repreſented by thoſe numbers; and thoſe quantities expreſſe and write downe in figures particularly in your booke of entries, to euery parcell whereunto they belong next after the quantities deliuered by the tenant. As for the particular quantities in the common fields, you ſhall not find them in the plot, but in your common field-booke, according to the direction thereof in <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3. before recited; which let thereby be expreſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>And the like courſe in all reſpects is to be holden with all other the entries throughout your whole booke.</p>
               <p>But it is to be conſidered, that one tenant may within this Mannor hold lands of ſeuerall eſtates, and by ſeuerall rents and ſeruices, as Free-hold, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold, Tenement Lands, &amp;c. yet are they all compriſed and repreſented within and by thoſe numbers expreſſed in the Index. In ſuch caſe you are to compare theſe numbers with the particular names expreſſed in your field-booke, and thoſe with the entries; and you ſhall moſt eaſily diſtinguiſh the one from the other, and expreſſe and aſſigne to euery of them their due and proper number and quantitie, as before.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it is here to be conſidered, that we haue not yet ſpoken of any means to expreſſe each mans particular quantitie in the common ſtinted paſtures, or ſheepe-walkes, whereof onely the generall quantitie is taken by meaſure, and expreſſed in the plot. Which to performe, worke thus.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe there is in the Mannor a ſtinted Cow-paſture, wherein euery te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath a certaine number of Beaſt-gates, ſome more, and ſome leſſe, which are vſually rated and ſtinted, either according to their rents, or after their quantities of knowne grounds, or their parts in the common arable fields: and imagine this paſture is found to containe by meaſure 212. Acres, 3. Roods, 20. Perches; firſt, collect out of your entries all the number of gates in the ſame paſture; which added together, let containe in the whole 116. Then reduce your meaſured quantitie into the loweſt denomination, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (according to the directions of <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.3.) whereby you ſhall find the ſame to be 34060. Perches: and ſuppoſing the tenant, whoſe quantitie you ſeeke, hath in the ſame paſture 10. beaſt-gates; by the rule of proportion rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus. If 116. the whole number of beaſt-gates, giue 34060. Perches, the whole quantitie, what giues 10. gates; and by increaſing 34060. by 10. and parting the product by 116. your anſwer will be 2936. Perches, and a ſmall quantitie more, the proportionall quantitie belonging to 10. gates; which reduced into acres (by <hi>Chap.</hi> 48.3. before recited) is 18. Acres, 1. Rood, 16. Perches. And in like manner worke with all the reſt. And here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hauing thus gotten the proportionall quantitie belonging to a beaſt-gate, and truely vnderſtanding the value of a beaſt-gate, you ſhall be able at pleaſure, and moſt certainely, to expreſſe by the acre the true yearely value thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:16637:119"/>
                  <hi>And thus haue you perfected your entries, for the true and certaine quantities, according to meaſure; and now reſteth the valuation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beſt, ſpeedieſt, and moſt certaine meanes for your valuation, in mine opinion, is thus: Let it firſt be conſidered, that all grounds generally conſiſt in qualitie of theſe three kinds, Meadow, Arable, and Paſture; and ſuppoſing euery of theſe kinds likewiſe to conſiſt of three ſorts in value and goodneſſe; as the firſt and beſt ſort; the ſecond and meane; and the third and worſt ſort: In your inſtrumentall menſuration, when you write in your field-booke the title of euery field or cloſe, conſider with your ſelfe, which of thoſe three ſorts the ſame field or cloſe conſiſteth of; if of the beſt ſort, expreſſe in ſome place of your title the figure 1. if of the ſecond ſort, the figure 2. and if of the third and worſt ſort, the figure 3. and hauing informed your ſelfe by the beſt meanes you can (which I hold not fitting here to relate) of the generall value, what the beſt ſort of Meadow, Arable, and Paſture, is worth by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and the like of the other ſorts, throughout the whole Mannor; then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe rates, paſſe ouer your whole booke of entries, and value e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular parcell by it ſelfe; which, by finding in each title of your field-booke of what ſort they are, is moſt ſpeedily and exactly performed. And thus are your entries thus farre perfected.</p>
               <p>But yet, before we proceed to the ingroſſing hereof, or rather before wee finiſh with the tenants concerning their entries, it is to be enquired and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what other profits and commodities, beſides theſe lands and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are demiſed and granted by the Lord to any tenant within the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for yearely rent, or otherwiſe; which likewiſe are to be entred and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in your rough booke, with the rents and yearely values thereof: as Mynes of Tynne, Lead, Copper, Coale, &amp;c. Quarries of Stone, Fiſhing, Fowling, Hawking, and Hunting, Iuiſtments, Herbage, and Pannage, free Warrens, Cuſtomarie workes, or Seruices, profits of Fayres and Markets, and moſſes of Peat or Turfe; all or any of which, and the like, may be within a Mannor, and diſpoſed and letten for yearely rents, which by no meanes are to be omitted. All which premiſſes, and the ſeuerall quantities, rents, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues thereof, are here to be ſummed vp, and their ſeuerall totals expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Then are you to expreſſe the ſeuerall repriſes iſſuing out of this Mannor, being ſuch as are mentioned in the ſixt Chapter of this Booke. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe ſummed vp, the totall thereof is to be deducted from the former value, and the cleare remainder expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Next are you to conſider, if any of thoſe profits and commodities, laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, or the like, are within this Mannor, and not letten by leaſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for any certaine yearely rent; and if any ſuch be, then are they to be here mentioned and expreſſed as caſualties, and the yearely value thereof eſtimated, what they may or are likely to proue worth by the yeare.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the names and quantities of the common Fields, common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, ſtinted Paſtures, and all other vnſtinted Commons, are here to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and of thoſe vnſtinted Commons, how they are accuſtomed, held, and occupied; whether peculiar to the Lord and tenants of this Mannor; or whether any other Lord or Lords, and their tenants, haue rake, eſcape,

               <p>Alſo, what woods and vnderwoods are within the Mannor, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall values.</p>
               <p>Then would there be entred an abſtract, in nature of a Cuſtome-roll, ſhewing briefely all the ancient cuſtomes of and belonging to the Mannor. And alſo a Suit-roll of all the free ſuitors, &amp;c.</p>

For mine owne part, I neuer yet for any two Lordſhips or Mannors limitted my ſelfe to one and the ſame forme; but euer framed my courſe as the cauſe required: as in one Mannor, where I find a commixture of other lands and tenements within the ſame, being holden of other Lords; here of neceſſitie muſt I abutt and bound euery ſeuerall particular thereof: but in another, which I find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, I hold it needleſſe. Againe, I find in one Mannor diuers and ſeuerall Towne-ſhips and parts, and thoſe to conſiſt of ſeuerall eſtates and tenures; in ſuch caſe, theſe are to be ſeuerally diſtinguiſhed and diuided, according to their ſeuerall parts. Another ſhall you find ſole and entire, which is to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered accordingly: and many other ſuch like differences ſhal you find, which will miniſter occaſion to alter any ſetled forme.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the will and diſpoſition of him by whom you are imployed, ſhall often cauſe you to alter your courſe: one perhaps approuing of the forme you vſe; another will haue it in the nature of your ancient Terrars; a third, in order of a Particular, or Conſtat; and a fourth, it may be, in a fourth forme; for <hi>Quot homines, tot ſententiae.</hi> And againe, one, for his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will haue it in Engliſh; and another, of better vnderſtanding, will require it in Latine. And certainely it were very requiſite, although your rough booke be drawne in Engliſh, that alwaies your ingroſſed booke be written in Latine; vnleſſe the contrarie be ſpecially required. Yet in theſe mine examples and directions following, I hold it moſt fitting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the ſame in Engliſh, for the better vnderſtanding of thoſe who haue moſt need; conſidering, that a reaſonable Surueyor may be lame of that legge.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding ſuch varieties often happen; yet will we for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie propoſe theſe rules and directions following; which I hold moſt meet and fitting to be obſerued and held in a formall and well ordered Suruey.</p>

               <p>NExt after this, or the like Title, in the following leafe, are you to write and expreſſe and Index or Alphabeticall Table of all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants names (as hath beene formerly taught) with numbers of reference againſt each name, in what leafe or leaues of the Booke each Tenants particular is to be found: But notwithſtanding, this Index is to be placed in your Booke firſt and next after the Title; yet is it moſt conuenient and fitting, to collect and write the ſame (and alſo the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall next hereafter following) after the whole Booke be ingroſſed; before which time, you ſhall not know how to place your numbers of reference therein, according to the number of the leaues.</p>
               <p>Then after this let next be placed a generall rentall of the whole Mannor, but to be diuided into ſuch towneſhips and parts, as your Booke is diuided into; wherein firſt expreſſe your rents of ſuch demeſnes, as are letten in leaſe, then the rents and ſeruices of your free-holds of inheritance. Thirdly, of your cuſtomarie or copy-hold tenants. Fourthly, of the tenants for life or liues. Fiftly, of thoſe for terme of yeeres: and ſixtly and laſtly, your tenants at will, wherein let euery of theſe beare their ſeuerall titles, and vnder the foot of each kinde, let the totall thereof be collected and expreſſed, and in the end or foot of the whole rentall, expreſſe firſt the totall of euery kinde, and after that the generall and totall ſumme of all together. And if any rents or other repriſes be iſſuing out of this Mannor, you may here expreſſe them particularly vnder the title of repriſes, which let be deducted out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer totall, and expreſſe the cleere remainder.</p>
               <p>And thus is our Rentall finiſhed; but to be collected and written (as I formerly noted) after the bodie and ſubſtance of the Booke be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed.</p>
